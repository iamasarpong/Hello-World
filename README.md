# Hello-World
Just another repository

I am an ICT enthusiast, passionate about how technology impacts our human behaviour. I am a graphic designer, a photographer, web and social media consultant - and most recently a cybersecurity trainee at CyberWayFinder, a three-year program for women who wants to start a cybersecurity career. I've also been selected for Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship at Udacity.
